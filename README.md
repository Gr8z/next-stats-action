# Next.js Stats GitHub Action

Compares stats between current `canary` branch and a PR branch for
- serverless sizes
- build duration
- base render size
- node_modules size
- client bundle sizes
- total build dir size

After generating stats, they are posted as a comment on the PR that triggered them.
